## Project Idea:

A website that helps generate color palettes.
Very much like Coolors.co and tools / websites.

## The Why?:

The goal of this project is not to create something new.
Instead, I want to try to build out a solution to a complex problem on my own.

## Problems:

1. How to extract color from an image.
2. How to take those colors and create a color palette.
3. How to generate color palettes on the basis of color theory.
4. Allow users to share color palettes.
5. Users can "love" color palettes.
