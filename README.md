## Project Idea:

A website that helps generate color palettes.
Very much like Coolors.co and tools / websites.

## The Why?:

The goal of this project is not to create something new.
Instead, I want to try to build out a solution to a complex problem on my own.

## Problems:

1. How to extract color from an image.
2. How to take those colors and create a color palette.
3. How to generate color palettes on the basis of color theory.
4. Allow users to share color palettes.
5. Users can "love" color palettes.
6. Tags on palettes stored in DB. (eg. Monochromatic, Analogous)
7. Checkers to make sure Tagged Palettes actually apply.
8. Example pages. (stretch)
9. Apply a theme to the actual website (stretch).
